# gw2-bot-goldprices
A Discord bot that notifies when gold prices drop below a certain threshold

This is a private bot run in a private server on a local desktop. It's not intended for wide use, but you might find it useful as an example of what works. Don't take it as an example of best practices, though. I'm new to Discord bots, and I hate JavaScript :)
